During the mourning activities, some abnormal situations also arose. A very few individuals took the opportunity to fabricate rumors, directly attacking party and state leaders... All comrades in the party and people across the nation must clearly recognize that if this turmoil is not resolutely stopped, the country will have no peace. This struggle concerns the success or failure of reforms, the future destiny of the nation. Party organizations at all levels of the Italian National Fascist Party, the broad masses of Fascist Party members, members of the Young Axemen League, various Fascist parties, patriotic Fascist figures, and the people of the nation must distinguish right from wrong, actively take action, and struggle to resolutely and swiftly stop this turmoil!"

As Ciano entered the courtyard, his personal guards were kept outside. Ciano immediately sensed something was wrong. When Ciano approached the main hall entrance, the action team specifically targeting him immediately approached. Ciano struggled somewhat, fighting back with punches and kicks. But Ciano was quickly subdued by the action team, his arms twisted behind his back, and taken into the hall. Mussolini announced the 'decision' to arrest Ciano. Before Mussolini finished reading, Ciano suddenly roared, broke free from the guards' grip, and lunged at Graziani from about five or six meters away.

The Italian border forces, having no other choice, were forced to rise up and counterattack... The consistent position of the Italian government and people is, 'We will not attack unless we are attacked; if we are attacked, we will certainly counterattack.' The border forces' forced counterattack is entirely a just action. We want to build our own country; we need a peaceful international environment; we do not want war, but we will never allow others to wantonly encroach upon our territory...

  IPUnion_country_event.39.d: "Previously, due to the people's army uprising, provinces responded, the nine continents boiled, living beings suffered. Specially ordered Mussolini to dispatch personnel to discuss the overall situation with representatives of the people's army, to convene a parliament, and publicly decide the form of government. For two months, no proper solution has been found. North and south are estranged, confronting each other. Commerce halts on the roads, scholars are exposed in the fields. Merely because the form of state has not been decided for a single day, the people's livelihood is unsettled for a single day. Now, the psychology of the people across the nation mostly leans towards republicanism. Southern provinces initiated it first, northern generals advocate for it later. Where people's hearts tend, Heaven's mandate can be known. How could I, for the glory of one family, go against the likes and dislikes of millions? Therefore, observing the general trend externally and examining public sentiment internally, I specially lead the Emperor to publicly transfer the ruling power to the entire nation, establishing a republican constitutional form of government. This will comfort the hearts of people within the seas weary of chaos and hoping for order in the near term, and accord with the ancient sage's principle of 'All under Heaven belongs to the public' in the long term. Mussolini was previously elected as Prime Minister by the Advisory Council. At this time of transition between old and new, a method for north-south unification is appropriate. Therefore, let Mussolini organize a provisional republican government with full authority, and negotiate unified measures with the people's army. The overall aim is to ensure people's safety, peace across the land, and a great Italian Republic. I and the Emperor can retire to leisure, pass the years comfortably, long receive the nation's courteous treatment, personally witness the completion of great governance. Would this not be admirable?'"

Death was passed.\nToday, Emanuele's day of fate arrived. A little past 9 a.m., Emanuele got off the special car taking him to the Place de la Révolution and came before the heavily guarded Blackshirt execution platform. Emanuele slowly walked towards the platform. 'Citizens, I die innocent...' His words were immediately drowned out by drum rolls. At 10:10, the blade fell. Spectators shouted, 'Long live the Republic!' Emanuele's remains were buried in a public cemetery, covered with a layer of quicklime to accelerate decomposition. Today, the daisy withers. Former King of Italy and Ethiopia of the Savoy Dynasty, Vittorio Emanuele Ferdinando Maria Gennaro di Savoia, former highest public official of the Kingdom of Italy, current citizen of the Italian Social Republic Vittorio Emanuele, after trial by the National Convention, was sent to the execution platform for the crime of treason."

There is an old Italian saying, 'Final judgment comes when the lid is on the coffin.' Although I am not yet 'coffined,' it's close; can a judgment be made? I have done two things in my life: First, I fought Haile Selassie for those years, driving him to those few islands; the three-year Spanish Civil War, sending the International Brigades back home. Few disagree with these matters, only a handful chirping in my ear,无非是无非是无非是 urging me to recover those islands sooner. The other matter you all know, which is bombarding the Neutralist Headquarters. Not many support this; many oppose it. These two things are not finished; this 'legacy' must be passed to the next generation. How to pass it? If peaceful handover fails, then pass it amidst turmoil; if not handled well, it might become 'bloody rain and foul wind'."

As Graziani entered the courtyard, his personal guards were kept outside. Graziani immediately sensed something was wrong. When Graziani approached the main hall entrance, the action team specifically targeting him immediately approached. Graziani struggled somewhat, fighting back with punches and kicks. But Graziani was quickly subdued by the action team, his arms twisted behind his back, and taken into the hall. Balbo announced the 'decision' to arrest Graziani. Before Balbo finished reading, Graziani suddenly roared, broke free from the guards' grip, and lunged at Ciano from about five or six meters away. At this critical moment, a guard nearby rushed forward, knocked him down, held him firmly, and handcuffed him."

Our party center's Minister Di, disregarding fatigue and sweat-soaked clothes, the scorching sun in the wheat fields, and the searing red fire by the molten iron furnace, walked through the vast area of Lastripoli town with full energy and radiant spirit. Comrade Grandi's thoughts, words, smiling face, and demeanor were thus deeply engraved in the hearts of the people of Lastripoli, engraved in the ever-leaping and boiling plains and hills here."

  IPUnion_leap_forward_event.6.d: "According to an urgent telegram from the Bologna Provincial Party Committee: Days of continuous heavy rain have caused floods and waterlogging across Italy. The Po River plain, where Bologna province is located, has been hit by a once-in-a-century flood. Farmland and infrastructure in major grain-producing towns like Bagnacavallo, Argenta, and Pieve di Cento have been devastated. When the regional investigation team surveyed and counted the disaster situation in the Po River plain, they discovered a huge gap between regional grain production data and actual grain storage. The actual grain harvested this year was only one-third of the figure reported by the Emilia-Romagna region to the central government. Currently, nearly 30% of the population in the Bologna area is already without food due to natural disasters. Leader Mussolini has ordered a thorough investigation of all major grain-producing regions since the Great Leap Forward movement."

The meeting pointed out that the temporary difficulty in market supply caused by poor agricultural harvests and insufficient light industrial raw materials is an urgent and important problem to solve.

Regarding heavy industry, due to tremendous development in recent years, the output of major products has far exceeded the levels planned for the latter two years of the industrial development plan. Next year, we should appropriately reduce the scale of capital construction, adjust the pace of development, and, building on the existing victories, adopt the policy of consolidating, filling out, and improving.

The square was crowded. A few individuals dressed noticeably differently enjoyed privileges not available to others — sitting on chairs, while the several thousand tribe members behind them could only stand. For thousands of years, a few military nobles could represent the thoughts of thousands behind them... But today the situation is different. Roughly made straw paper with candidate lists was orderly distributed to the several thousand people present. All they had to do was tick the candidate they liked, and then this anonymous ballot would be cast into the box. Although this election is a non-competitive election where every candidate can be elected, although many elders might tick all candidates indiscriminately, one day, one day..."
